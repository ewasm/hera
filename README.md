# Hera ![Status](https://circleci.com/gh/ewasm/hera.svg?style=shield&circle-token=:circle-token)

Hera is an [ewasm] (revision 4) virtual machine implemented in C++ conforming to [EVMC] ABIv6.

It is designed to leverage various Wasm backends, both interpreters and AOT/JITs.

## Client support

Hera has been tested with [aleth] and [geth]. It should however work with any client with compliant [EVMC] support.

## Building Hera

First clone this repository and make sure the submodules are checked out:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ewasm/hera
$ cd hera
$ git submodule update --init
```

The preferred way is building Hera as a shared library:

```bash
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON ..
$ cmake --build .
```

In this case the built library will be placed at `build/src/libhera/libhera.so` on Linux or `build/src/libhera/libhera.dylib` on MacOS.

Please also check the build options listed in the following section.

## Build options

- `-DHERA_DEBUGGING=ON` will turn on debugging features and messages
- `-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON` is a standard CMake option to build libraries as shared. This will build Hera shared library that can be then dynamically loaded by EVMC compatible Clients (e.g. `aleth` from [aleth]). **This is the preferred way of compilation.**

### Binaryen support

*Complete support.*

[Binaryen] is built by default and needs no build options. It can be disabled with:

- `-DHERA_BINARYEN=OFF`

### wabt support

*Complete support.*

[wabt] support needs to be enabled via the following build option and requested at runtime with `engine=wabt`:

- `-DHERA_WABT=ON` will request the compilation of wabt support

### WAVM support

*Complete support.*

[WAVM] support needs to be enabled via the following build option and requested at runtime with `engine=wavm`:

- `-DHERA_WAVM=ON` will request the compilation of WAVM support
- `-DLLVM_DIR=...` one will need to specify the path to LLVM's CMake file. In most installations this has to be within the `lib/cmake/llvm` directory, such as `/usr/local/Cellar/llvm/6.0.1/lib/cmake/llvm` on Homebrew.

## Runtime options

These are to be used via EVMC `set_option`:

- `engine=<engine>` will select the underlying WebAssembly engine, where the only accepted values currently are `binaryen`, `wabt`, and `wavm`
- `metering=true` will enable metering of bytecode at deployment using the [Sentinel system contract] (set to `false` by default)
- `evm1mode=<evm1mode>` will select how EVM1 bytecode is handled
- `sys:<alias/address>=file.wasm` will override the code executing at the specified address with code loaded from a filepath at runtime. This option supports aliases for system contracts as well, such that `sys:sentinel=file.wasm` and `sys:evm2wasm=file.wasm` are both valid. **This option is intended for debugging purposes.**
- `fuzzing=true` will enable fuzzing mode, which aborts on an internal error (as opposed to transmitting the error code to the client). **This option is solely intended for fuzzing purposes.**

### evm1mode

- `reject` will reject any EVM1 bytecode with an error (the default setting)
- `fallback` will allow EVM1 bytecode to be passed through to the client for execution
- `evm2wasm` will enable transformation of bytecode using the [EVM Transcompiler]

## Interfaces

Hera implements two interfaces: [EEI] and a debugging module.

### Debugging module

- `debug::print32(value: i32)` - print value
- `debug::print64(value: i64)` - print value
- `debug::printMem(offset: i32, len: i32)` - print memory segment as printable characters
- `debug::printMemHex(offset: i32, len: i32)` - print memory segment as hex
- `debug::printStorage(pathOffset: i32)` - print storage value as printable characters
- `debug::printStorageHex(pathOffset: i32)` - print storage value as hex

These are only enabled if Hera is compiled with debugging on.

### EVM Tracing

- `debug::evmTrace(pc: i32, opcode: i32, cost: i32, sp: i32)`

This is useful to trace the translated code by [EVM Transcompiler]. This is only enabled if Hera is compiled with debugging on.

**Note:** it is valid to invoke `evmTrace` with a negative value for `sp`.  In this case, no stack values will be printed.

## Fuzzing

To enable fuzzing you need clang compiler and provide `-DHERA_FUZZING=ON` option to CMake.
You should also enable both Binaryen and WABT engines.
This will build additional executable `hera-fuzzer`.
Check out its help and [libFuzzer documentation](https://llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html).

```bash
test/fuzzing/hera-fuzzer -help=1
```
