# Hera

Hera is an [eWASM](https://github.com/ewasm/design) virtual machine implemented in C++ conforming to the [Ethereum VM API](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/56).

It can be used with [cpp-ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/cpp-ethereum) and perhaps in the future with other implementations through appropriate bindings.

Currently it uses [Binaryen](https://github.com/webassembly/binaryen)'s interpreter for running WebAssembly bytecode and it should be improved to support the [WAVM](https://github.com/AndrewScheidecker/WAVM) as a backend.

## Build options

- `-DHERA_DEBUGGING=ON` will turn on debugging features and messages
- `-DHERA_METERING_CONTRACT=ON` will pass contract creation data through the metering contract residing at 0x00..0a
- `-DHERA_EVM2WASM=ON` will use the evm2wasm contract translate EVM bytecode (through the contract residing at 0x00..0b)
- `-DHERA_EVM2WASM_EVM_TRACE=ON` will output a trace step for each transpiled EVM opcode

## Runtime options

These are to be used via EVM-C `set_option`:

- `fallback=true` will allow EVM bytecode to be passed through to the client for execution (if set to `false`, the default, it will be rejected as invalid)
- `evm2wasm.js=true` will use a `evm2wasm.js` as an external commandline tool instead as a system contract

## Interfaces

Hera implements two interfaces: [EEI](https://github.com/ewasm/design/blob/master/eth_interface.md) and a debugging module.

### Debugging module

- `debug::print32(value: i32)` - print value
- `debug::print64(value: i64)` - print value
- `debug::printMem(offset: i32, len: i32)` - print memory segment as printable characters
- `debug::printMemHex(offset: i32, len: i32)` - print memory segment as hex
- `debug::printStorage(pathOffset: i32)` - print storage value as printable characters
- `debug::printStorageHex(pathOffset: i32)` - print storage value as hex

These are only enabled if Hera is compiled with debugging on.

### EVM Tracing

- `debug::evmTrace(pc: i32, opcode: i32, cost: i32, sp: i32)`

This is useful to trace the transpiled code from [evm2wasm](https://github.com/ewasm/evm2asm). This is only enabled if Hera is compiled with debugging on.

**Note:** it is valid to invoke `evmTrace` with a negative value for `sp`.  In this case, no stack values will be printed.

## Caveats

Although Hera enables the execution of eWASM bytecode, there are more elements to eWASM an Ethereum node must be aware of:

- [backwards compatibility](https://github.com/ewasm/design/blob/master/backwards_compatibility.md) provisions
- injecting metering code to eWASM contracts
- transcompiling EVM1 contracts to eWASM if desired

All of the above must be implemented outside of Hera.
